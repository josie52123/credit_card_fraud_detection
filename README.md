# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project/Goals
Overview:

The primary objective of the project is to gain insights into credit card fraud through exploratory data analysis, which includes creating visualizations and dashboards to observe and identify trends in various aspects. This involves:

1. Analyzing the distribution of transaction amounts between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
2. Examining transactions based on the time of day.
3. Identifying geographical patterns of transactions.
4. Investigating the correlation between certain variables and the occurrence of fraud.
5. Assessing whether specific merchants are more susceptible to fraud than others.
6. Exploring activities of individuals who are noticeable for fraudulent activities, including analyzing their Date of Birth (DOB), job information, and genders.

Additionally, a secondary objective is to explore and develop a regression model based on the available dataset.
